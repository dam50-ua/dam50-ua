# Heya guys

This Github account is mainly used in college stuff in "Universidad de Alicante".

## What will i find in this profile?

Nothing interesting, all my repositories are private ones (but you are seeing this, right? At least my bio is public).

## Which program you think is your biggest achievement?

I'm very proud of this one:

```c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  cout << "Hello world!" << endl;
}
```

## Do you have some goals as a programmer?

I currently want to graduate. Everything coming next it's just some extra. I would love to make some web apps, desktop apps and videogames. Also I'm trying to learn how to make sprites and stuff. Learning english is also a big goal tho.

## Are you learning any programming languages?

I'm focusing on C++, Java and Python and I want to learn Ruby, C#, JavaScript and whatever could be useful to me. I also accept sugestions.

## And that's it, nothing more to say

Thank you for reading this profile. It will be updated soon.
